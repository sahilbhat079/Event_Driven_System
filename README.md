Event-Driven In-Memory Notification System
------------------------------------------

Overview:
This Java project implements an in-memory event-driven notification system based on the publisher-subscriber pattern. It supports role-based user access and custom filtering of events, all driven through a centralized EventBus. Events are not lost even if a subscriber is temporarily offline due to an internal PriorityQueue.

User Roles:
- SUBSCRIBER: Subscribes to publishers and receives events that pass custom filters.
- PUBLISHER: Creates and publishes TaskEvents and PriorityEvents.
- ADMIN: Has global visibility and can view/report all events.

Core Concepts:
- EventBus: Central engine responsible for managing subscriptions and dispatching events.
- Event: Each event (e.g., TaskEvent, HeartbeatEvent, PriorityEvent) includes a timestamp and a priority.
- Filter: Each subscriber has a filter (PriorityFilter, TimeWindowFilter, AlwaysTrueFilter) that determines which events to accept.
- PriorityQueue: Stores accepted events per subscriber in order of priority.
- SchedulerManager: Periodically generates heartbeat events using a fixed-rate scheduler.

How It Works:
1. The application starts with initializing the EventBus and registering default publishers (e.g., system, hr, tech).
2. A heartbeat scheduler emits recurring HeartbeatEvents from the system publisher.
3. The user logs in or registers with a specific role.
4. Based on their role, a CLI menu is shown:
   - PUBLISHER: Can publish new events (task or priority).
   - SUBSCRIBER: Can view and process their filtered events from a priority queue.
   - ADMIN: Can view global event logs and perform analytics.
5. When an event is published, the EventBus dispatches it to all subscribers of that publisher.
6. Each subscriberâ€™s filter determines if the event should be accepted. If yes, it is added to their queue.
7. Subscribers can manually process events from their queue.

How to Run:
- Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
- Compile the project (Java 17+ recommended).
- Run the MainApp.java class.
- Follow the prompts to log in as SUBSCRIBER, PUBLISHER, or ADMIN.
- Use the CLI menus to interact with the system (publish events, view notifications, etc.).
- The system gracefully shuts down all schedulers on exit.

Technologies Used:
- Java 17+
- Maven for build management
- java.util collections (Map, Set, PriorityQueue)
- java.time for timestamps and scheduling
- OOP principles: Interface, Abstract Classes, Builder Pattern

Key Features:
- Multiple publishers and subscribers
- Custom filters on events
- In-memory message queues (PriorityQueue)
- Heartbeat event generation via scheduler
- CLI-based interaction per user role
- Cleanly layered architecture
